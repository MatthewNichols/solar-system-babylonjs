# WebGL Solar System using Babylon.js

This a playground space for me learning [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/) by building a 3D solar system model. It is not a very good model because the main point is to have a set of interesting problems to learn against. Poke around if it pleases you. 

Below is a current render. The real one is dynamic and increasingly interactive. The latest build can be seen at https://solar-system-babylonjs.netlify.app/.
